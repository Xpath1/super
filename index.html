            Hi there! Welcome to my<sup>****</sup> super game emulator! Here you can play GB, GBA, GBC, NES, and N64 games. All on the same website!<br>
            Now about those asterisks. All roms are taken from <a href="https://github.com/AlexBlackmore/roms">roms</a>. The GBA emulator is taken from <a href="https://github.com/andychase/gbajs2">gbajs2</a>, the GBC emulator <a href="https://github.com/ardean/jsGBC">jsGBC</a>, the GB emulator <a href="https://github.com/juchi/gameboy.js/">gameboy.js</a>.<br>
            All I did was merely put them all into one place.<br><br>
            GB emulator: <a href="https://xpath1.github.io/super/gb/">GB</a><br>
