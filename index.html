            Hi there! Welcome to my*********** super game emulator! Here you can play GBA, GBC, NES, and N64 games. All on the same website!
            Now about those asterisks. All roms are taken from <a href="https://github.com/AlexBlackmore/roms">roms</a>. The GBA emulator is taken from <a href="https://github.com/andychase/gbajs2">gbajs2</a>, the GBC emulator <a href="https://github.com/ardean/jsGBC">jsGBC</a>.
            All I did was merely put them all into one place.
