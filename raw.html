    Hi there! Welcome to (not) my super game emulator! Here you can play GB, GBA, GBC, NES, and N64 games. All on the same website!<br>
    Now about those asterisks. All roms tested are taken from <a href="https://github.com/AlexBlackmore/roms">roms</a>, I advise you use this for roms too.<br>
    The GB emulator is taken from <a href="https://github.com/juchi/gameboy.js/">gameboy.js</a>, the GBC emulator <a href="https://github.com/ardean/jsGBC">jsGBC</a>, the GBA emulator <a href="https://github.com/andychase/gbajs2">gbajs2</a>, the NES emulator <a href="https://github.com/takahirox/nes-js">nes-js</a> and the N64 emulator <a href="https://github.com/nbarkhina/N64Wasm">N64Wasm</a>.<br>
    All I did was merely put them all into one place.<br><br>
